# This is a image classification project working with OpenAI API

By: Kyler Conant

### This GitHub contains comments, code, screenshots of results, and pictures used for this program.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### This model uses only 3 classifications - dog, rabbit, and bird. It should be able to tell from any picture submitted, if it is not any of the classifications it will say "I can't identify any rabbits, dogs, or birds in the image."
